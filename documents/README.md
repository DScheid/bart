## SEO and Analytics

Search Engine Optimization is a strategy for understading and working with search engines in order to increase the likelihood of our websites having 'hits' for a given search. Each search engine has protocols for a finding properly matching sites. There are certain inclusions and exclusions that front-end developers can make to take advantage of these protocols.

For example, there is meta-data. Meta-data is content that you include on your site, that the user doesn't see, but that the search engines DO see. With meta-data you can place information that will help match your website with the potential searches that you anticipate an ideal user conducting.

There are also other rules such as the 'Heading' rule. Search engine 'crawlers' will go through your site, looking for the content in your <h_> tags. Content in your larger headings, like h1 will be taken more seriously than a h6 tag for example. Tangent to this rule, you do not want to use more that one H1 tag on a given page, as to not confuse the crawler. 

Overall, there are strategies and methods to increase the likelihood that people will find and visit your site. Properly using meta-data and <h_> tags is a great way to get started.


## Approach

My plan for implementing SEO is to adjust the meta data on each page. Since NUXT generates the routes for each particular page, I'm guessing that the search engines seach each one of these sites. For this reason, I think I am safe to have an H1 tag on each page. Because of this, and due to the importance of H1 tags for SEO I made sure each one of my pages had 1 and only 1 H1 tag. In addition, I also put a description in my meta tag. I made sure to be concise since I know google will truncate to 150 characters anyway. I put useful keywords in these descriptions as well
